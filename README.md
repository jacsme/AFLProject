# AFLProject
This project is developed using Java 8 with Maven, Junit and Mockito. The code is organized through a controller, service, constant, enums and util. Jacoco is not included at the moment.

# CONTROLLER
The controller is the main program. As for the purpose of execution it methods were coded in a plain main method. Which eventually can be replace as restful api if necessary. 

# SERVICE
The service classes are composed of interface class and implemented class. These will promote code maintainability and reusability for the future enhancement. The implementing classes are the actual execution of the project. 

# CONSTANT
Constants variables are place here to make it reusable to some future usage.

# ENUMS
This project uses enums to ensure the correct usage of condition particularly in the number iterations.

# UTIL
This is for the utility classes which will help the service classess implementation to process some calculation, these are refactored methods.

Childrenâ€™s Game
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
totalChildren - is the number of Children will play the game.
runningNumber - is the number that was selected to stop the counting and the number that pointed to it will be eliminated. 
winnerChild - is the final number which was the last number left.

Number Iterator
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
integersLength - is the total number of the sequence, this will be the basis of the code to iterate over the sequence. 
firstNumber - is the number that is divisible by selected number
secondNumber - is the number that is divisible by selected number

The program will append each item to String Builder together with the sequence number and the word FOO if it is divisible by firstnumber. 
The program will append each item to String Builder together with the sequence number and the word BARis if it is divisible by secondnumber
The program will append each item to String Builder together with the sequence number and the word BAZ if it is divisible by both firstnumber and secondnumber. 

The code was coded to include some enums for other divisibilities however the main code conditions only limited to odd numbers.
